#Manhole Detection System

# Overview
This project leverages computer vision to detect manhole covers in a live video stream from a webcam. The system uses the SSD MobileNet model for object detection and communicates the status (open or closed) via serial communication. Additionally, it sends SMS notifications using the Twilio service.

# Hardware Requirements
Webcam
Microcontroller for Serial Communication (e.g., Arduino)
Internet Connection (for Twilio SMS)
# Software Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
Twilio API
Serial Communication Library (cvzone.SerialModule)
# Installation
1.Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/chandiran07/manhole-detection-system.git
cd manhole-detection-system
2.Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Set up the hardware components, including the webcam and microcontroller for serial communication.

# Configuration
1.Create a Twilio account and obtain API credentials.
2.Update the keys.py file with your Twilio API keys and other configuration details.
# Usage
1.Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python manhole_detection_system.py
2.View the live video feed with manhole detection and status updates on the console.

# Code Explanation
.The script captures video frames from the webcam, performs object detection using SSD MobileNet, and communicates manhole status through serial communication and Twilio SMS.
.Detected manhole covers are labeled as "manhole_closed" or "manhole_open."
.Serial communication signals are sent based on the detection status.
.Twilio SMS notifications are sent for both open and closed manhole covers.
